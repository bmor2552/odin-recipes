          <p>As the days go by my hunger for more knowledge continues to grow. Unfortunately for me I cannot live in front of my computer.
          If I let another day <strong><em>"go by"</em></strong> my stomach WILL hate me! So what do you do when the hungry bug bites you? Well, you can drink water, or you can fill your body up with a meal fit for a coder!</p> <br>

          <p>Thanks to Odin's Kitchen, I don't have to waste energy on thinking about what I want to eat!
          No more wasting time preparing meals either. 

          All I need is 15 minutes and voila, I am back at it again, coding my little heart out. Don't be shy, give one off Odin'd recipes a try!
          I promise you will be satisfied.</p>
