# Odin's Kitchen 
As I embark on this new path of Web Development, I will need to practice as much as possible. 

The more I practice, the more I will fail, the more I fail, the more I will learn. The more I learn the less will I fail. 

*Pauses for dramatic affect and confused stares*

In this project I will be creating a basic, and I mean basic recipe blog site using only HTML. Lets get started !

# What I Have Learned 
After completing the project, I can say that the basics of git and html are now apart of my memory. 
The next step will be to implement basic CSS to make the blog site more appealing to the eyes.
