As I embark on this new path of Web Development, I will need to practice as much as possible. 

The more I practice, the more I will fail, the more I fail, the more I will learn. The more I learn the less will I fail. 

*Pauses for dramatic affect and confused stares*

In this project I will be creating a basic, and I mean basic recipe blog site using only HTML. Lets get started !
